Hi there! You're an awesome person and I appreciate you buying this thing wot I did :)

This pack is a simple, colourful world map set for a fantasy setting. The art style is semi-inspired by Earthbound/Mother though not strictly of that style. These assets have been arranged in a 16x16 grid and are relatively easy to edit or rearrange.

If you like the pack and end up using it to create a game, please consider popping my name "Darby Machin" into the credits of your project.
