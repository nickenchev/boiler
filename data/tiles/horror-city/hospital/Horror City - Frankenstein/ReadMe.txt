Hi there! You're an awesome person and I appreciate you buying this thing wot I did :)

This pack is a collection of tiles created for my POP! style of RPG Horror graphics. Featuring environment tiles comprising of walls, floors, hospital beds, machinery, equipment, seats, elevator doors, asylum tiles, accents and more, this tile pack is perfect for bringing a cutely gritty, grungey look to your horror/zombie games. Arranged in both original sized 16x16 and "plug and play" 32x32 RPG Maker VX Ace formatting for ease of use.

Also included is a small bonus pack of materials never before released outside of special promotions! Featuring a modern twist on Dr Frankenstein and her monster, complete with full, 4-directional sprites and portraits as well as animated screens and eqiupment. The majority of this content has been made previously available under an RPG Maker Only license via RPGMaker.web and via RPG Maker dlc on Steam - however, this version allows these characters for the first time, to be used in any game creation engine you like!

Other POP! and Horror City graphics will be made available on itch soon for use in all engines, but if you're an RPG Maker user, all currently released POP! graphic packs are available on Steam - search for POP! Horror City or check out the DLC sections for RPG Maker VX Ace and RPG Maker MV!
