* Camera and OpenGL Integration
** Figure out which entities are within the current view
   1. Initialize Camera details
      - Camera Rect: Used for keeping track of X, Y position and WIDTH and HEIGHT of view.
   2. Detect which objects need to be drawn.
      - Use basic bounding box collision to decide which which objects are within view.
      - Use calculation based on tile size to figure out exactly which tiles to draw:
        * camera.width / tile.width = number of tiles horizontally
        * camera.height / tile.height = number of tiles vertically
